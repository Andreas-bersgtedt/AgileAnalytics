# AgileAnalytics

This Repository contains documentation on how to implement a working DevOPS practice for an Analytics and Data engineering team.

It is a collection of best practices that has been developed and desighned by thought leaders in the industry over the last few decades.



The documentation is broken up in two sections:

1. [An Introduction to agile development practices](./Project-Overview/An-Introduction-to-agile-development-practices.md)
2. [Agile Patterns and DevOPS processes](./Project-Overview/Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes.md)

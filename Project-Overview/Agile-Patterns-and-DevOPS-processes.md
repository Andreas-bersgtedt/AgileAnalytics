**_Successful agile development teams rely heavily on templatized operational patterns and frameworks.
In this section we will discuss some of the fundamental patterns and frameworks._**

# The Operational Stack

To start off we need to look at the [**operational stack**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/The-Operational-Stacks.md), this will determine what technology will be used and how to integrate the development activities into the operational products and releases, for more details on this please visit [**this section**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/The-Operational-Stacks.md). 

# Integration

Once we have decided on what operational stack we are working with we can then start planning out how we want to [**integrate**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/CI-CD-Pipelines.md) this into our deployment environments and what we need to do in order for this to be reliable, repeatable and scalable, for this step please review [**this section about CI/CD Pipelines**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/CI-CD-Pipelines.md)


# Source Control

When we think about source control we must also think about how we operate as a team, it is easy to just discard source control as being just a repository or a dumping ground for our work, however there are many nuances to a source control system and how it integrates with our [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)software, [CI/CD Pipelines](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/CI-CD-Pipelines.md), working cadence, planning and more, one of the most important aspects about how we interact with our source control repositories is defined by a [**branch strategy**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/Branch-Strategy.md)

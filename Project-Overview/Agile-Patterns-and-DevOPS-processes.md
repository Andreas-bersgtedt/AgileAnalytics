**_Successful agile development teams rely heavily on templatized operational patterns and frameworks.
In this section we will discuss some of the fundamental patterns and frameworks._**

#The Operational Stack

To start off we need to look at the [**operational stack**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/The-Operational-Stacks.md), this will determine what technology will be used and how to integrate the development activities into the operational products and releases, for more details on this please visit [**this section**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/The-Operational-Stacks.md). 

#Integration
Once we have decided on what operational stack we are working with we can then start planning out how we want to [**integrate**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/CI-CD-Pipelines.md) this into our deployment environments and what we need to do in order for this to be reliable, repeatable and scalable, for this step please review [**this section about CI/CD Pipelines**](./Agile-Patterns-and-DevOPS-processes/CI-CD-Pipelines.md)

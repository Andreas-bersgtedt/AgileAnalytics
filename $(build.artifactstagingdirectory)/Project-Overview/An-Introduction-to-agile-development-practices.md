# Introduction
[As defined by the Agile Aliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

_"Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it. When you approach software development in a particular manner, itâ€™s generally good to live by these values and principles and use them to help figure out the right things to do given your particular context."_

In other words Agile development is a set of **values** and **principles** that defines why we do what we do. 


# History

[Agile practices can be traced back to the late 1700s but has its prominence with Toyota as the modern pioneer in the field of just in time manufacturing and operating model starting formally in 1949 ](https://strategosinc.com/RESOURCES/04-Lean_History/Lean_History.htm), the year 2001 is particularly significant to the Agile software development practices as this is when the formalisation of the [Agile Manifesto](https://web.archive.org/web/20020806081355/http://agilemanifesto.org/) was conceived.

# Principles

Agile software development is primarily driven by principles that align with delivery of value and customer satisfaction though early and continuous delivery cycles.

As defined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://web.archive.org/web/20020806081355/http://agilemanifesto.org/) the principles are:
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
1. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
1. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
1. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
1. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
1. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behaviour accordingly.
